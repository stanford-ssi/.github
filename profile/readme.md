Welcome to Stanford Student Space Initiative (Stanford SSI). We are a student-run organization founded in 2013 with a with the mission of giving future leaders of the space industry the hands-on experience and broader insight they need to realize the next era of space development. Our 300+ dues-paying members are divided into seven project teams: Rockets, Satellites, Balloons, Mars, Biology, Operations, and Policy. Since our inception, we've broken five world records, launched satellites into orbit, taught accredited courses, and inspired hundreds of people. We have short-term goals to fly a liquid rocket and finish development of our open source satellite bus, and a long term goal to fly and then retropropulsively land a hybrid rocket. Join us to push the boundaries of what is possible in the new space age.
